# Outgoing Male

**Outgoing Male** is a Unity game inspired by *Flappy Bird*, reimagined with original mechanics, visuals, and meta-progression.  
Instead of a bird, you control a **winged envelope** navigating a surreal digital/postal world.

This project is developed alongside the band **Daphne + The Glitches**, and shares its name and themes with the song *Outgoing Male*.
